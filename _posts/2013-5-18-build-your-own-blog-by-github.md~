Build your own blog by github
====

  What's github? Github is like facebook among programmers. GitHub offers both paid plans for private repositories, and free accounts for open source projects. Today, GitHub is the most popular open source code repository site.
  Today I will show you the way to use GitHub to build your own blog. It's free and so easy to use. Compared to other blog websites like tumblr, you can build a site in whatever you like, not in a template, although you may spend more time on it.
  So, let's start.

## About os ##
  I strongly recommend you use GitHub on Linux. Here is a link for [Download for Linux, Mac, Windows and Solaris](http://git-scm.com/downloads). I don't know the exact difference between these OS, but I will use Ubuntu 12.04 to show you the process.
  And of course, you should sign up on GitHub.

## SSH keys ##

#### 1. Check the SSH keys
  we should check on the ssh key on PC.

        $ cd ~/.ssh
 
  if the terminal shows "No such file or directory",then go to step 3, otherwise go on.

#### 2. Back-up and remove the former ssh key

        $ ls
        config  id_rsa  id_rsa.pub      known_hosts
        $ mkdir key_backup
        $ cp id_rsa* key_backup
        $ rm id_rsa*

#### 3. Creat new SSH key

  enter the code below in terminal, the default one is enough, so just press ENTER.

        $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "username@youremail.com"
        Generating public/private rsa key pair.
        Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/your_user_directory/.ssh/id_rsa):	        (Just press enter)

  Then you may have to set your passphrase:

        Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
        Enter same passphrase again:

  When you see this kind of thing, congrats!

#### 4. Add SSH key to GitHub

 Assume you have signed in GitHub and you can see *Accout settings* on the right top. Click it and you can see *SSH Keys* on the left. Click it and copy the ssh keys in the column. Like this.

#### 5. Test it

  enter this code to test whether it's good or not.

        $ ssh -T git@github.com

  if this kind of thing shows, relax, just enter yes.

        The authenticity of host 'github.com (207.97.227.239)' can't be established.
        RSA key fingerprint is 16:27:ac:a5:76:28:2d:36:63:1b:56:4d:eb:df:a6:48.
        Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?

  and you may see


        Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.


#### 6. Set your account information

  When you push a post or change sth in repo, the Git will check your account name and it's very important for your authentication, you definitely don't want to use other random name.

        $ git config --global user.name "yourname"
        $ git config --global user.email "yourname@youremail.com"
